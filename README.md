# Homicide-Data
Homicide Data Science Project - DataQuest

This is my version of the Guided Project: US Gun Deaths, taken from DataQuest (which I highly recommend!).
I have only uploaded it here to test out how GitHub works, and I have probably made many mistakes, but I am here to learn and as it is only on my respository, it shouldn't matter too much!
